# Memory Game
This creates a memory game where you flip cards and if they match, you keep them flipped. You win by having all of the cards flipped. I had a lot of fun making this game because it reminded me of when I used to play this as a child with my uncles.
### Rules:
- Click on two cards to reveal their colors
- If you get two colors that match, then they stay flipped
- If the cards don't match, then they are flipped back over, hiding their colors
- Your goal is to match all of the cards in the fewest amount of tries. I hope your brain is up to the challenge!
